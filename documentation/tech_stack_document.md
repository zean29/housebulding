# Tech Stack Document for the "housebulding" Project

This document explains, in everyday language, the technology choices we recommend for building the "housebulding" application—a platform for planning, designing, and managing residential construction projects. Each section describes the tools and services chosen, and why they fit the project’s needs.

## 1. Frontend Technologies

We want the user interface to feel modern, responsive, and intuitive—whether someone is drawing a floor plan or checking a Gantt chart. Here’s how we’ll make that happen:

- **React (with TypeScript)**
  - A popular library for building web interfaces. TypeScript adds clear typing, which helps prevent bugs and makes the code easier to maintain.
- **Redux (or Context API)**
  - Manages shared data (like user sessions or project settings) so different parts of the app stay in sync.
- **Three.js (and/or React-Three-Fiber)**
  - Renders 2D/3D floor plans in the browser. Lets users drag-and-drop walls, doors, and windows—and view them in three dimensions.
- **D3.js (or Recharts)**
  - Creates interactive charts and dashboards, such as budget variance graphs or timeline Gantt charts.
- **Styled-Components (or CSS Modules)**
  - Enables writing component-specific styles in JavaScript files, keeping style definitions close to the code they affect.
- **Mapbox GL JS (optional)**
  - If site assessments require maps (e.g., zoning or geographic data), Mapbox provides smooth, interactive map views.
- **Webpack (or Vite)**
  - Bundles and optimizes frontend code, ensuring fast page loads and efficient caching.

How these enhance the user experience:
- Fast, reactive interfaces with live updates.
- Smooth 2D/3D graphics for design modules.
- Clear, interactive charts and maps.
- Consistent styling and theme across the application.

## 2. Backend Technologies

The backend handles data storage, business rules (like scheduling logic), and exposes APIs that the frontend calls. Here’s our proposed setup:

- **Node.js with NestJS**
  - A server framework built on Node.js, offering a structured, modular approach (inspired by Angular) that makes the codebase easier to navigate.
- **GraphQL (Apollo Server)**
  - A flexible API layer where the frontend can request exactly the data it needs, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching.
- **PostgreSQL (with PostGIS extension)**
  - A reliable relational database. PostGIS adds geographic data support for site assessments and zoning.
- **Redis**
  - An in-memory store for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., project metadata) and managing real-time features like notifications.
- **Socket.io (WebSockets)**
  - Powers real-time updates for chat, notifications, and live timeline changes.
- **Bull (Redis-based queue)**
  - Manages background jobs (e.g., sending emails, generating PDF reports, performing heavy calculations).

How these work together:
- The frontend sends queries or mutations via GraphQL.
- NestJS resolves those requests, interacting with PostgreSQL and Redis as needed.
- Real-time events flow through WebSockets, ensuring users see updates instantly.

## 3. Infrastructure and Deployment

We aim for a stable, scalable, and automated environment so new features roll out smoothly:

- **Docker & Docker Compose**
  - Containers isolate services (backend, database, cache) to ensure environment consistency across development and production.
- **Kubernetes (or AWS ECS)**
  - Manages container clusters, auto-scales services, and replaces unhealthy instances to keep the app running.
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
  - **EKS/ECS** for containers, **RDS** for the database, **ElastiCache** for Redis, **S3** for file storage (e.g., floor-plan exports).
- **GitHub (or GitLab) for Version Control**
  - Tracks code changes, supports pull requests, and enforces review workflows.
- **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**
  - Runs automated tests and builds, then deploys to staging or production environments on commit or merge.

Benefits:
- Consistent environments from developer laptops to production servers.
- Automated testing and deployment reduce manual errors.
- Scalability to handle growing user traffic and large models.

## 4. Third-Party Integrations

To speed up development and add advanced features, we integrate with established services:

- **SendGrid (or AWS SES)**
  - Sends email notifications (e.g., project updates, invitations).
- **Twilio (optional)**
  - SMS or phone alerts for critical timeline changes.
- **Stripe (optional)**
  - Processes payments if the platform offers premium subscriptions or add-on services.
- **Sentry**
  - Captures application errors and performance metrics, helping the team quickly pinpoint issues.
- **Google Analytics (or Mixpanel)**
  - Tracks user behavior and feature usage to guide future improvements.

These integrations:
- Provide reliable communication channels.
- Offer insights into app health and user engagement.
- Allow for monetization and subscription management.

## 5. Security and Performance Considerations

We put security and speed at the forefront to protect user data and deliver a smooth experience:

- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for session management.
  - Role-based access control to restrict features (e.g., only architects can edit floor plans).
- **HTTPS Everywhere**
  - All traffic is encrypted in transit with TLS certificates (managed via AWS Certificate Manager or Let’s Encrypt).
- **Data Encryption at Rest**
  - Sensitive data in PostgreSQL and S3 is encrypted using AWS KMS.
- **OWASP Best Practices**
  - Input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Caching & CDN**
  - Frontend assets (JavaScript, CSS) served via a Content Delivery Network to reduce load times globally.
  - Redis caches frequent API responses.
- **Database Indexing & Query Optimization**
  - Ensures that complex queries (e.g., resource estimation calculations) run quickly.

Outcome:
- Secure handling of project and user data.
- Fast-loading pages and responsive interactions.

## 6. Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

In summary, the "housebulding" application uses a modern, well-integrated set of tools to meet its goals:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript, Three.js, D3.js for a rich, interactive user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js with NestJS, GraphQL, PostgreSQL (+ PostGIS), Redis, WebSockets for robust data handling and real-time features.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes (or AWS ECS), AWS managed services, and GitHub Actions for reliable deployment and scaling.
- **Integrations**: SendGrid, Sentry, optional Twilio/Stripe, and analytics to enhance communication, monitoring, and monetization.
- **Security & Performance**: JWT auth, TLS encryption, data-at-rest encryption, CDN, caching, and database tuning ensure a secure and fast platform.

These technology choices align with the project’s vision of a unified, easy-to-use environment for constructing and managing residential building projects. They also position us for future growth, easier maintenance, and seamless integration of new features.
