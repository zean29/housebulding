# Security Guidelines for housebulding Application

## Introduction
This document presents security guidelines tailored for the **housebulding** project—a unified platform for planning, designing, and executing residential construction projects. It covers secure design, implementation, and deployment best practices to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability across all modules.

---

## 1. Security Principles
- **Security by Design:** Embed security in every phase—from requirements through deployment.  
- **Least Privilege:** Grant each component and user only the minimum permissions needed.  
- **Defense in Depth:** Layer controls (network, application, data) so a single failure does not compromise the system.  
- **Fail Securely:** On error or exception, do not leak sensitive details or leave resources in an insecure state.  
- **Secure Defaults:** Ship with hardened configurations; require explicit opt-in for weaker settings.

---

## 2. Authentication & Access Control
1. **User Authentication**  
   - Enforce strong password policies (minimum 12 characters, complexity rules).  
   - Store passwords using Argon2 or bcrypt with unique per-user salts.  
   - Support multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin and sensitive roles.
2. **Session Management**  
   - Issue cryptographically random session identifiers; store in `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict` cookies.  
   - Implement idle and absolute session timeouts; provide secure logout and session revocation.
3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
   - Define roles (e.g., Architect, Contractor, Client, Admin) and map minimal privileges.  
   - Enforce authorization checks server-side on every request; never trust client roles.
4. **API Authentication**  
   - Use short-lived JWTs signed with strong algorithms (e.g., RS256).  
   - Validate token signature, issuer, audience, and expiration on each request.  
   - Keep private keys in a secure vault (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager).  
   - Implement token rotation and revocation mechanisms.

## 3. Input Handling & Data Validation
1. **Server-Side Validation**  
   - Validate all inputs against strict schemas (JSON Schema, ORM models).  
   - Reject unexpected or malformed data early.
2. **Prevent Injection Attacks**  
   - Use parameterized queries or ORM frameworks for database access.  
   - Escape or sanitize inputs used in dynamic SQL, system commands, or template engines.
3. **XSS Mitigation**  
   - Encode user-supplied data in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS contexts.  
   - Enforce a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict script sources.
4. **CSRF Protection**  
   - Embed anti-CSRF tokens in all state-changing forms and AJAX requests.  
   - Verify the token on the server before processing.
5. **File Upload Security**  
   - Restrict file types and scan for malware.  
   - Store uploads outside the webroot; serve via controlled endpoints.  
   - Enforce size limits and sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal.

## 4. Data Protection & Privacy
1. **Encryption In Transit**  
   - Enforce TLS 1.2+ on all transports (HTTPS, WebSockets, API calls).  
   - Redirect HTTP traffic automatically to HTTPS.
2. **Encryption At Rest**  
   - Encrypt databases and object storage volumes using AES-256.  
   - Use field-level encryption for highly sensitive PII (e.g., social security numbers).
3. **Secrets Management**  
   - Store API keys, database credentials, and encryption keys in a dedicated secrets store.  
   - Rotate secrets periodically and on suspected compromise.
4. **Logging & Monitoring**  
   - Log authentication attempts, privilege changes, and critical actions.  
   - Mask or omit sensitive data (PII, tokens) from logs.  
   - Integrate with a centralized SIEM to detect anomalies.

---

## 5. API & Service Security
- **Rate Limiting & Throttling:** Enforce per-user and per-IP limits to mitigate brute-force and DoS attacks.  
- **CORS Policy:** Allow only trusted origins and restrict allowed methods/headers.  
- **HTTP Methods:** Use GET for safe retrieval, POST/PUT for modifications, DELETE only where necessary.  
- **API Versioning:** Prefix endpoints with `/v1/`, `/v2/` to manage changes without disrupting clients.  
- **Minimal Data Exposure:** Return only the fields required by the client; avoid verbose default responses.

---

## 6. Web Application Security Hygiene
- **Security Headers:**  
  - Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)  
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff  
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY  
  - Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade  
  - Content-Security-Policy: define trusted sources for scripts, styles, images.
- **Cookie Hardening:** Use `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict` attributes.  
- **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Apply SRI hashes to trusted CDN assets.

---

## 7. Infrastructure & Configuration Management
1. **Server Hardening**  
   - Disable unused services; remove default accounts.  
   - Keep OS and middleware patched with the latest security fixes.
2. **Network Controls**  
   - Limit exposed ports via firewall rules (e.g., only 443 for web traffic).  
   - Implement network segmentation (e.g., separate database and application tiers).
3. **TLS Configuration**  
   - Disable weak ciphers and protocols (TLS 1.0/1.1).  
   - Use certificates from a reputable CA and automate renewals.
4. **Deployment Pipeline (CI/CD)**  
   - Run automated security scans (SAST, SCA) on each commit.  
   - Prevent direct pushes to production branches; require peer reviews and passing tests.  
   - Store pipeline credentials securely and enforce MFA for deploy actions.

---

## 8. Dependency Management
- **Lockfiles:** Commit `package-lock.json`, `Pipfile.lock`, or equivalent to ensure deterministic builds.  
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate tools (Dependabot, Snyk) to detect and auto-alert on CVEs.  
- **Regular Updates:** Schedule periodic reviews to upgrade outdated or insecure libraries.  
- **Minimal Footprint:** Include only necessary dependencies; remove unused packages promptly.

## 9. Module-Specific Considerations
### 9.1 Floor-Plan Editor & 3D Modeling
- Sandbox any client-side script processing (e.g., WebGL shaders).  
- Validate file imports (e.g., DXF, SVG) to prevent malformed files from triggering parser exploits.

### 9.2 Scheduling & Gantt Charts
- Ensure user-supplied schedule data cannot trigger algorithmic complexity attacks.  
- Rate-limit bulk updates to prevent resource exhaustion.

### 9.3 Collaboration & Document Sharing
- Implement strict ACLs on documents; use expiring share links.  
- Version history tamper protection (e.g., append-only logs).

### 9.4 Reporting & Analytics
- Aggregate user metrics with privacy in mind; anonymize data where possible.  
- Guard against injection in report templates.

### 9.5 Integrations & Plugins
- Authenticate and authorize third-party callbacks; use signed webhooks.  
- Sandbox plugin execution and restrict file system access.

## Conclusion
By following these guidelines, the **housebulding** platform will establish a robust security posture, protecting user data and maintaining trust. Incorporate these controls early, revisit them regularly, and adapt as new threats emerge.
