# App Flow Document for housebulding

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user first arrives at the housebulding platform, they land on a clear and engaging public page that introduces the product and its value in managing residential construction projects from start to finish. From this landing page, the user can choose to sign up or log in. To create a new account, the user clicks the “Sign Up” button and is presented with a simple form asking for name, email address, and password. Alternatively, the user can opt to register by connecting their Google or LinkedIn account in a single click. Once the form is submitted, a confirmation email is sent, and the user verifies their address by clicking the link. If they ever forget their password, the “Forgot Password” link on the login page guides them through entering their email and receiving a password reset link. After resetting their password, they can log in again. When the user finishes a session, they can sign out from a dropdown under their avatar in the header, which returns them to the login screen.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Immediately after logging in, the user sees the main dashboard. The top header shows the housebulding logo on the left and, on the right, a search bar, notifications bell, and the user’s avatar with a menu for account settings. To the left of the screen, a vertical navigation bar lists Projects, Requirements, Design, Estimation, Schedule, Procurement, Collaboration, Reports, Integrations, and Settings. The central area of the dashboard displays an overview of active projects with thumbnail cards showing project name, status, and next milestone. Below that, a timeline widget highlights upcoming deadlines and recent activity. The user can click on any project card to dive into its details or use the navigation bar to go directly to a module for a specific project.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

### Project Creation and Selection

On the main dashboard, the user selects the “New Project” button in the Projects section. They enter the project name, client information, address, and expected start and end dates. When they submit, the new project appears in the list on the dashboard and in the sidebar under Projects. Clicking the project name opens the project’s home view, where all modules become active for that project.

### Requirement Definition Flow

Inside a project, the user clicks the Requirements tab and sees a list of predefined templates for site assessments, client wishlists, and zoning rules. The user selects a template and fills in relevant fields such as site size, local regulation notes, or budget constraints. They can add or remove fields as needed and save the requirement set. The saved requirements appear in a table that the user can edit, export as PDF, or share with stakeholders for review.

### Architectural Design and Floor-Plan Editor

From the project’s navigation bar, the user opens the Design module and loads the floor-plan editor. A blank canvas appears with a toolbar for placing walls, doors, windows, and structural elements. The user drags elements onto the canvas and adjusts dimensions by dragging handles. As they build, the system runs real-time checks against local building codes and highlights any rule violations in red. The user can switch to a 3D preview to rotate and inspect the design. Once satisfied, the user saves the plan, and the file is versioned so they can revert to earlier drafts if needed.

### Resource Estimation and Cost Calculation

When the user moves to the Estimation tab, the system automatically performs quantity takeoffs based on the latest floor-plan data. A cost breakdown appears, listing materials, labor rates, equipment rentals, and contingency allowances. The user can input or adjust supplier unit prices, select markup percentages, and compare different cost scenarios side by side. They then save the chosen estimate scenario and can download a detailed cost report in spreadsheet or PDF format for client proposals.

### Scheduling and Timeline Management

Selecting the Schedule module, the user views an interactive Gantt chart that shows tasks, durations, and dependencies. The system suggests initial sequencing based on the design deliverables and resource availability. The user can add or remove tasks, adjust start and end dates by dragging bars, and link tasks to show dependencies. When dates change, the chart updates automatically. If a task slips or a delivery arrives early, the chart realigns other tasks. The user can flag milestones and subscribe teammates to notifications about critical path shifts.

### Materials Procurement and Inventory Control

In the Procurement module, the user sees current inventory levels and pending purchase orders. When a material stock drops below a threshold, a warning appears prompting the user to create a new purchase order. The user enters supplier details, item quantities, delivery dates, and shipping information before submitting the order. The system tracks order statuses and receipts, updating on-site inventory automatically when deliveries are confirmed. If integrated with barcoding or RFID, each scanned item updates stock levels in real time.

### Collaboration and Communication Hub

The Collaboration section presents a messaging interface alongside a document portal. The user can upload blueprints, contracts, or photos and tag team members or clients in comments. Each document and message thread is versioned so the user can see change history and approval statuses. The platform sends notifications when someone comments or uploads a new version. Role-based permissions ensure that only authorized users can view sensitive cost or design details.

### Reporting and Analytics

When the user enters the Reports module, they choose from templates like Budget Variance, Schedule Adherence, Safety Incidents, or Custom Report. After selecting parameters such as date range and project phase, the system generates interactive charts and tables. The user can drill down into data points, export charts as images, and download full reports in PDF or CSV formats. They can schedule recurring reports to be emailed to stakeholders at set intervals.

### Extensibility and Integration

In the Integrations area, the user sees a list of available connectors such as accounting software, geographic information systems, or engineering analysis tools. For each integration, the user enters API keys or OAuth credentials and configures data sync settings. Once set up, purchase orders can flow into accounting, or site coordinates can feed mapping services. The user tests the connection and then saves it, after which data exchange happens automatically in the background.

### Administration and User Roles

For users with administrator privileges, an Admin panel is accessible from the Settings section. Admins can invite new users by email, assign roles like Project Manager, Architect, Contractor, or Client, and set module-level access rights. They can also view audit logs of user activity, manage subscription tiers if the platform is on a paid plan, and configure global settings such as company branding and default templates.

## Settings and Account Management

Clicking the user avatar in the header brings the user to Settings. The Profile page lets them update personal details, change password, or switch linked social accounts. The Notifications page allows toggling email, in-app, or SMS alerts for events like design approvals or delivery delays. The Billing page displays the current subscription plan, usage metrics, invoicing history, and upgrade or cancellation options. After making changes, the user saves settings and returns seamlessly to the last active module by clicking the back arrow in the header.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If the user enters invalid information in any form, the field is highlighted in red with a concise error message explaining the issue, for example “Please enter a valid email address” or “Timeline end date must be after start date.” If the user’s session expires or they lose connectivity, a banner appears at the top indicating the problem and offering a “Retry” button once the network is restored. In the floor-plan editor, design rule violations are flagged in red overlays with explanatory tooltips. Any unauthorized action, such as accessing another project without permission, redirects the user to a friendly error page that suggests returning to the dashboard or contacting support.
